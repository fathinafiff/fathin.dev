excerpt: 'In Lubok Batee Village, where catfish farming is vital, technological integration has addressed challenges like delayed feeding and improper portions. Our study introduces an Arduino Uno-based automatic catfish feeding system. Designed for efficiency and productivity, it uses a sound sensor to detect hunger cues, distributing the daily feed of 2,500 grams with 98% efficiency. This innovative solution aims to enhance catfish cultivation, reduce waste, and improve the livelihoods of the village residents.'

The rapid advancement of technology in various fields, including fisheries, has brought significant progress in recent times. The integration of technology is expected to address numerous issues, such as those encountered in catfish farming in Lubok Batee Village. Catfish farming constitutes a major source of livelihood for the residents of this village. However, several problems persist, including delayed feeding, improper feeding portions for catfish, and waste generation due to uneaten feed settling. The objective of this study is to develop an automatic feeding system for catfish farming to resolve these issues. The automatic feeding system is designed using conceptual design methods to improve efficiency, reduce human error, and consider feeding patterns to enhance productivity and value for catfish cultivation. This system is designed using such as Arduino Uno, dynamo, servo motor, relay, and Arduino IDE software. Data is obtained through a nineteen-day simulation by installing a prototype in a catfish farming pond in Lubok Batee Village. The simulation results demonstrate that the automatic catfish feeding system functions effectively. The sound sensor can detect sound levels of 50 dB or higher, produced by water splashes when the fish are hungry, and is capable of distributing the daily feed requirement of 2,500 grams. Additionally, the system feeds the catfish 4-5 times per day with an efficiency rate of 98%.
