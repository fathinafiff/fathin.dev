title: "Bike Sales Analysis"
excerpt: "In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of bicycle sales data using Microsoft Excel. The process involved meticulous data cleaning, including standardizing column names, removing duplicates, and creating age brackets for a more insightful analysis. I utilized advanced Excel functionalities such as pivot tables and graphs to summarize earnings by gender, sales by distance, and identify the top 5 sales by age group. The final deliverable included interactive dashboards that provide actionable insights for businesses in the cycling industry."

# **🗂️** About Data Set

For this Excel Portfolio Project, data is being sourced from Alex The Analyst's GitHub repository. The repository contains a variety of datasets that are relevant to the project's goals, which include analyzing and visualizing data to uncover insights and trends. These datasets are being used to create a robust and comprehensive analysis that will provide valuable insights into the data. As the project progresses, additional data sources may be added to further enhance the analysis and provide even more insights. Overall, the use of multiple data sources will help to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the analysis, and will allow for a more thorough understanding of the data.

# **🧹** Data Cleaning

- Making Copy Raw Dataset to Working Sheet
- Standardize Columns Name
    > Marital Status > MaritalStatus
    Home Owner > HomeOwner
    Commute Distance > CommuteDistance
    Purchased Bike > PurchasedBike
    > 
- Remove Duplicate and Remove Extra Space using Trim Formula
- Replace Spelling for M and S on Marital Status and M and F for Gender Columns, for make easier understanding the data
- Remove Symbols on Income Columns
- Making AgeBrackets Columns base on Age Columns to make Later Visualization Easier
    
    > Adolescent (<31)
    Middle Age (31 - 54)
    Old (55 and 55+)
    > 

# **🫶** Summarize The Data

- Create Pivot Table about “Average Income by Gender Customers Who Buy or Don't Buy Bikes”
- Create Pivot Table about “Calculating Total Sales Purchased or Not Bikes Based on Customer Commuter Distance”
- Create Pivot Table about “Calculating Total Sales Purchased or Not Bikes Based on Customer Age Brackets”
- Create Pivot Table about “Calculating Top 5 Total Sales Purchased Bikes Based on Customer Middle Age”

# **🎬** Visualizations

## Making Graphs

- Graph about “Average Income by Gender Customers Who Buy or Don't Buy Bikes”
The graph reveals a significant income difference between male and female bike customers compared to non-customers. Male bike customers have a higher average income than females. This may be influenced by factors like marital status, region, and education.

- Graph about “Calculating Total Sales Purchased or Not Bikes Based on Customer Commuter Distance”
The graph shows that bike sales are influenced by customer mileage. Most purchases occur for distances under 1 mile, suggesting bikes are popular for short trips. Sales decrease as distance increases, possibly due to preference for cars or public transport. Sales for distances over 10 miles are very low.

- Graph about “Calculating Total Sales Purchased or Not Bikes Based on Customer Age Brackets”
The graph shows sales of bikes by age group. The largest sales are in the 31-54 age range. This group may have more money to spend on leisure activities or be more health-conscious.

- Graph about “Top 5 Total Sales Purchased Bikes Based on Customer Middle Age”
This graph analyzes sales data for middle-aged customers' bike purchases, showing the top 5 most purchased bikes. Customers aged 36 purchased the most, followed by 38 and 37. The data reveals insights into their purchasing behavior, including a preference for high-quality, reliable bikes that provide a comfortable riding experience. These customers are likely health-conscious and enjoy outdoor activities like cycling.

## ✍️ ****Making Dashboard

- Making Dashboard Header
- Input Graphs to Dashboard then Alight for Visual Reason
- Make Slicer or Filter for Dashboard Base on Costumer Marital Status, Region, and Education.

A slicer or filter is a useful tool that can provide more precise data for each segment, helping to refine and provide a granular view of the analyzed information. For this analysis, we are using this tool to create an interactive dashboard that can visualize various factors in this dataset.

## **📈** Dashboard View

This Dashboard View with Excel was created to visualize data on income by gender, sales by commuter distance and age bracket, and top 5 sales by middle age. The dashboard includes a variety of helpful features, such as slicers for customer marital status, region, and education. By incorporating these features, the dashboard provides users with a more comprehensive and detailed view of the data. Additionally, the dashboard offers insights into how various factors, such as gender and age, impact sales and income. Overall, this dashboard is an essential tool for anyone seeking to gain a deeper understanding of their business's performance and customer demographics.

## **💡 Recomendation**

Based on the insights gained from the analysis and visualization of the data, the following business recommendations can be made:

- Focus on promoting bicycles as a convenient mode of transportation for short distances, particularly for customers who travel less than 1 mile.
- Develop marketing strategies that specifically target middle-aged customers (ages 31-54), as they are the key demographic for bike sales.
- Consider developing high-quality bikes that are reliable and provide a comfortable riding experience, as this is a preference for middle-aged customers.
- Use the data to identify new market opportunities and develop products that cater to the preferences of middle-aged customers.

These recommendations can help businesses to improve their performance and increase their customer base, leading to higher profits and a stronger market position.
