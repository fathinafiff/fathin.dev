Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive dashboard providing insights into the Seattle Airbnb market. The dashboard includes information on the best locations for starting an Airbnb business, purchase and rent prices by area, and customer price ranges by bedrooms. The visualization tools used, such as bar and geo maps, line graphs, and tables, empower clients to make informed decisions.

Here's a glimpse of the visual representation of the analysis:
