In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of E-commerce sales data spanning from August 2021 to August 2022 using SQL and Tableau on the Google Cloud platform. Leveraging the data analysis skills acquired from the Revou Mini Course, I unearthed valuable insights into trends and patterns inherent in the big dataset. These findings hold immense potential for enhancing business performance, optimizing marketing campaigns, and facilitating informed decision-making.

Here's a glimpse of the visual representation of the analysis:
