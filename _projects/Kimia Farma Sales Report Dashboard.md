This project involved designing and constructing a data mart using MySQL Workbench. The base table integrated data from sales, customers, and products, while an aggregate table offered condensed information for streamlined analysis. Additionally, a sales report dashboard was developed using Looker Data Studio, providing a visually appealing and informative representation of the sales data.
