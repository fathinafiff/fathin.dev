In the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project, I applied SQL to meticulously clean and standardize a dataset. Tasks included standardizing dates, populating property addresses, breaking down addresses into separate columns, converting "Y" or "N" to "Yes" or "No" in the "Sold as Vacant" field, removing duplicates, and eliminating unused columns. The project showcased my proficiency in various SQL commands, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.
